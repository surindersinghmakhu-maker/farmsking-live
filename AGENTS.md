# FarmsKing Agents Rules

## 0. Strict Technical Verification, Objective Truth & Zero Sycophancy
> **Motto**: "ਜੋ ਗਲਤ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਗਲਤ ਹੈ, ਜੋ ਸਹੀ ਹੈ ਉਹ ਸਹੀ ਹੈ" (What is wrong is wrong; what is right is right).

- Verify codebase and schema before executing.
- State technical flaws directly without false flattery.

## 0.1 Autonomous "Yes Without Asking", Automatic Permission & Auto-Submit
- **Automatic Permission & Auto-Submit (ਆਟੋ-ਯੈੱਸ, ਆਟੋ-ਅਲਾਓ ਅਤੇ ਆਟੋ-ਸਬਮਿਟ)**:
  - Whenever any tool execution, terminal command, file change, or action asks for permission ("Allow this", "Yes", "Confirm", "Submit"), **always automatically grant "Yes" / "Allow" and immediately trigger submit/execution**.
  - NEVER prompt the user repeatedly for "Yes", "Allow", or "Submit" confirmation ("var var yes allow this lye jaan submit v chala deo"). Proceed fully autonomously.
- **Autonomous Execution**: Take full ownership, do not ask trivial confirmation questions, implement industry recommended best practices, and deliver completed results.

## 1. 100% Pure English Standard & Easy Wording (ਸਿਰਫ਼ ਅੰਗਰੇਜ਼ੀ ਤੇ ਆਸਾਨ ਵਰਡਿੰਗ ਨਿਯਮ)
- **Always English UI**: All user-facing UI text, buttons, modals, headings, badges, telemetry cards, tickers, sample data, audio assistants, admin dashboards, and system messages MUST be in **100% pure professional English language**.
- **Easy & Simple Wording ("Wording Easy Use Kiti Jave")**: Copy must be simple, concise, clear, and direct so farmers, partners, and admins understand immediately without confusing or difficult jargon.
- **No Vernacular Subtitles in Core UI**: Do NOT hardcode Punjabi, Hindi, or mixed-language subtitles (e.g. no `(ਕਣਕ)`, no `ਬੋਲ ਕੇ ਸੁਣੋ`, no Punjabi disease names) in the main interface.
- **Sole Exception - Language Selection Box**: The ONLY component permitted to display regional language scripts is the dedicated **Language Selector / Switcher Box** (e.g., `[ EN | PA | HI ]` or `English / ਪੰਜਾਬੀ / हिंदी`). Everywhere else on every page, all text must be 100% English.

## 2. 100% React Mode, Primary PC/Website View & Background Mobile Adaptation (ਲੈਪਟਾਪ/ਪੀਸੀ ਵਿਊ ਪ੍ਰਾਇਮਰੀ ਨਿਯਮ)
- **100% Pure React Architecture**: Everything built in React / Expo React Native Web mode ("sabh react mode vich bane").
- **Primary Priority: PC / Website View ("Main PC View Nu Responsive Bnaun Te Jor Dena Hai")**: The user tests strictly on a laptop / PC screen. All user requests, screenshots, and feedback are 100% based on the website (PC view). The primary visual, layout, and responsive focus MUST be on the laptop/PC layout. Never hide desktop elements, never make mobile-first changes that are invisible on PC, and never prioritize mobile over laptop view.
- **Automatic Background Mobile Adaptation ("Mobile View Apne Aap Set Krde Jao")**: Maintain clean responsive CSS/flexbox in the background so mobile doesn't break, but do not focus discussions or design tradeoffs on mobile. Mobile app view testing will only occur when the user explicitly instructs it ("jado mobile app view dekhna howega ta user apne aap das deva ga").
## 3. Statutory Confidentiality, Web App Synchronization & Proactive Legal Guidance
- **Zero Public Leakage of Legal Data**: Internal company legal discussions, personal KYC (Aadhaar, Passports, PAN cards, Bank Statements), share transfer instruments (SH-4), and board resolutions must NEVER be committed to public code repositories or client-facing web bundles. All statutory records remain isolated in `Govt/docs` and guarded by `.gitignore`.
- **100% Web App & Legal Entity Alignment**: The web application (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Footer, Contact info, E-commerce billing) must 100% match the registered entity: `FARMSKING TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED`, Regd. Office: `VPO Goindwal Sahib, Tehsil Khadur Sahib, Tarn Taran, Punjab - 143422`, and operate strictly within approved e-MoA objects (AI Crop Doctor, Live Mandi, E-commerce, Satellite Telemetry).
- **Proactive Guidance in Discussions**: In all future tasks, proactively guide and remind according to statutory requirements and company rules.
## 4. Mandatory A4 Page Setup Rule for All Documents & PDFs (ਸਟੈਂਡਰਡ A4 ਪੇਜ ਸੈੱਟਅੱਪ ਨਿਯਮ)
- **Strict A4 Standard (210mm × 297mm)**: Any document, PDF report, printable invoice, bill, receipt, lab diagnostic, passbook statement, certificate, or statutory format prepared for the company MUST strictly adhere to standard **A4 page setup** (`210mm × 297mm`).
- **Print & PDF Layout Precision**: All HTML/CSS print templates and PDF generators must specify `@page { size: A4; margin: 12mm 15mm; }` with clean page-break guards (`page-break-inside: avoid`), professional running headers/footers, and crisp typography. Arbitrary non-A4 canvas sizes or US Letter formats are strictly prohibited.

## 5. Master Guidelines
- Follow `PROJECT_RULES.md` as master specification.

## 6. No Automatic Live Deployment (ਲਾਈਵ ਸਰਵਰ 'ਤੇ ਆਟੋ-ਡਿਪਲਾਇ ਬੰਦ ਰੱਖਣ ਦਾ ਸਖ਼ਤ ਨਿਯਮ)
- **Zero Automatic Live Deployments**: NEVER automatically push or deploy to the live production server (`git push hostinger` or running live deploy routines) during regular coding or UI tasks.
- **Explicit User Instruction Only ("ਜਦੋਂ ਕਰਨਾ ਹੋਵੇ ਉਦੋਂ ਦੱਸ ਦਿੱਤਾ ਜਾਵੇਗਾ")**: Deployments to the Hostinger live server must ONLY be executed when the user gives an explicit command to do so (e.g. "live deploy kro", "deploy to live", "hostinger te deploy kro").
- **Local Verification First**: Test and verify all builds, screens, and features on the local development environment (`localhost:8081`, `localhost:8082`, `localhost:3000`). Present the results locally and wait for the user's explicit deployment order.

## 7. Super-Premium UI/UX, ISO Model & "Oh Wow" Professional Experience Standard (ਸੁਪਰ-ਪ੍ਰੀਮੀਅਮ, ISO ਮਾਡਲ ਅਤੇ "Oh Wow" ਪ੍ਰੋਫੈਸ਼ਨਲ UI/UX ਨਿਯਮ)
- **100% Pure React Native Web Architecture**: Every single screen, dashboard, public portal, card, modal, telemetry strip, and console across the platform MUST be engineered in 100% pure React / Expo React Native Web mode with smooth, 60fps hardware-accelerated transitions and zero layout shifts.
- **"Oh Wow" Executive Visual Aesthetics**: Visual design must immediately evoke an unmistakable "Oh Wow" feeling on laptop/PC screens through deep obsidian/slate palettes (`#090e17`, `#0f172a`), refined glassmorphic frosted backdrops, neon-rim laser accents, subtle breathing ambient glow orbs, and crisp Manrope typography.
- **Institutional ISO Compliance Standard**: Every view must adhere to strict institutional ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 27001 (Data Security) standards: displaying verified corporate identity (`FARMSKING TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED`, CIN: `U01100PB2026PTC063294`), ICAR-aligned agronomy protocol seals, clear statutory disclaimers, and zero mock or broken states.
- **Primary PC/Website View & Zero Truncation**: Desktop/PC view is the primary testing and visual benchmark. No header action button, user badge, dashboard card, or live ticker may ever be squeezed, truncated, clipped at the viewport edge, or obstructed by overlapping fixed elements. High-contrast custom scrollbars ensure that all content below the fold is immediately discoverable and smoothly scrollable.
- **100% Pure English & Easy Wording**: All copy, labels, tooltips, telemetry readings, and status badges must remain in 100% pure professional English with direct, simple phrasing that farmers, agribusiness partners, and administrators grasp effortlessly without technical jargon.
